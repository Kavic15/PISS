We are enhancing our mobility, coordination, and rapid response capabilities, which are crucial for fulfilling our missions both at home and abroad.\n\nOur main priority is to ensure that our logistics processes are as effective and reliable as possible. This involves not only modernizing our equipment but also investing in the training of our soldiers, who must be ready for any situation.\n\nThe development of logistics is not just about technology, but also about the human factor – expertise, speed, and precision in every step we take.
